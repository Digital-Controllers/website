# Flight Information Services

A Flight Information Service (FIS) is a type of Air Traffic Service (ATS) that provides information to pilots, normally, flying outside controlled airspace. The provision of such a service allows for pilots to have easy access to up-to-date aerodrome and meteorological information, and traffic information to assist the pilots in avoiding collisions.

In DC, we have two Flight Information Services:

- Basic Service
- Radar Service

## Basic Service

A Basic Service (BS) allows aircraft to get information from a controller or Flight Information Service Provider (FISP) who does not have access to any form of radar or surveillance system. The information provided under a BS is:

- Weather information
- Changes of servicability of facilities
- Conditions at aerodromes
- General airspace activity information
- Any other information likely to affect safety.

For aircraft under a basic service, traffic avoidance is solely the pilot's responsibility, but controllers may provide suggestions to assist in this, these are known as 'agreements'.Unless entered into an agreement, pilots have ultimate freedom, as long as they remain outside controlled airspace.

## Radar Service

A Radar Service (RS) can only be provided by a controller who has access to a radar or surveillance system, this allows them to provide specific traffic information and avoiding action on top of the information provided in a Basic Service.

Traffic avoidance is still the pilot's responsibility but the controller is able to assist with deconfliction if the aircraft involved do not report traffic in sight after traffic information.
