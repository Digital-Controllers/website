A departure clearance is a set of instructions given by air traffic control to a pilot determining the path they will need to follow after takeoff. The issuing of departure clearances is typically the duty of the ground movement planner (Delivery) controller but is absorbed into GMC (Ground) when no GMP is online.

## VFR Clearance

Visual Flight Rules clearances **MUST** only be issued during daytime and within Visual Meteorological (VMC) conditions. Clearances should include instructions of exiting the airfield control zone (if applicable). This may consist of a departure direction or a Visual Reference Point, if a VFR chart is available for that airfield. All VFR clearances **MUST** be coordinated with the AIR (Tower) controller.

If a pilot wishes to enter the traffic circuit, this is known as "to remain".

!!! example "VFR Example"

    **Pilot:** Anapa Ground, Fastjet 345, [single/_number_] [aircraft type] at [apron/ramp name], ready to taxi, VFR to Krymsk.
    
    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, Anapa Ground, after departure cleared to leave control zone via Stadium Lane, not above altitude 2500 feet, QNH 29.92, squawk 1234.
    
    **Pilot:** After departure cleared to leave control zone via Stadium Lane, not above 2500 feet, QNH 29.92, squawk 1234, Fastjet 345."
    
    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, readback correct, taxi to [...].

For VFR clearances, the AIR controller **MAY** opt to give departure clearance at the holding point, right before takeoff.

!!! example "Clearance at holding point"

    **Pilot:** Anapa Ground, Fastjet 345, [single/_number_] [aircraft type] at [apron/ramp name], VFR flight to Krymsk, ready to taxi.
    
    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, Anapa Ground, taxi to [...], expect clearance at the hold.
    
    **Pilot:** Taxi to [...], roger, Fastjet 345.
    
    **Nearing holding point:**
    
    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, Contact Tower, 123.450.
    
    **Pilot:** Contact Tower, 123.450, Fastjet 345.
    
    **Pilot:** Anapa Tower, Fastjet 345, holding short of [runway], ready to copy clearance.
    
    **Tower:** Fastjet 345, Anapa Tower, after departure [...]
    
    **Pilot:** After departure [...], Fastjet 345.

## IFR Clearance

IFR flights will be given predefined departure routes called Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs), if available. The alternative is radar vectoring provided by the area controller after departing the airfield control zone. 

IFR clearances **MUST** be delivered in a standardised format. This format contains:

- Clearance Limit: the point to which the clearance is valid. Typically the departure aerodrome but may also be a MOA, waypoint etc.
- Initial Route: The initial route for the aircraft to follow after departure. Typically a Standard Instrument Departure (SID).
- [Squawk](../general-knowledge/radar_theory.md): The transponder codes to be set by the aircraft.

!!! example "IFR Clearance example with SID"

    **Pilot:** Krasnodar Ground, Fastjet 345, [single/_number_] [aircraft type] at [apron/ramp name], request clearance to Sochi.

    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, Krasnodar Ground, advise ready to copy IFR clearance.

    **Pilot:** Ready to copy, Fastjet 345.

    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, cleared to Sochi, NALUD1F departure, squawk 1234.

    **Pilot:** Cleared to Sochi, NALUD1F departure, squawk 1234, Fastjet 345.

    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, correct, report ready to taxi.

A departure which does not follow a SID is voiced as follows. Unless stated in a standing agreement, these **MUST** always be coordinated with INT.

!!! example "IFR Non-SID Departure"

    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, cleared to Sochi, after departure, fly runway heading, climb to altitude 5000 feet, QNH 29.92, squawk 1234.

    **Pilot:** Cleared to Sochi, after departure, fly runway heading, climb to altitude 5000 feet, QNH 29.92, squawk 1234, Fastjet 345.
    
    **Ground:** Fastjet 345, correct, report ready to taxi.
