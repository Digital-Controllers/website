# General Knowledge

The general knowledge section contains the following information:

- [Radiotelephony](./radiotelephony.md)
- [Radio Theory](./radio_theory.md)
- [Radar Theory](./radar_theory)
- [Altimetry](./altimetry.md)
- [Meteorology](./meteorology.md)
- [Flight Rules](./flight_rules.md)
- [ATC Positions](./positions.md)
- [Airspace](./airspace.md)
- [Flight Information Services](./fis.md)

This is mostly theoretical information that is useful for all control positions **NOTE:** that does not mean that everyone needs to know this from the beginning - the best way of learning how to control is to go and do it - come back to the theory later!
