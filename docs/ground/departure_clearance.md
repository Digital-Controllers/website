A departure clearance is a set of instructions given by air traffic control to a pilot determining the path they will need to follow after takeoff.The issuing of departure clearances is one of the duties of the Ground controller. Busier airports may staff a dedicated Clearance/Delivery controller which will focus purely on the issueing of clearances.

##Simplified Clearance

There may be occasions in which a simple departure clearance, often just a departure heading and altitude level, will be assigned to pilots. 

!!! example "Simplified Clearance"
  Pilot: "Anapa Ground, Fastjet 345, [single/_number_] [aircraft type] at [apron/ramp name], ready to taxi."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, Anapa Ground, after departure fly runway heading, climb to 3000 feet, [QNH1013 HPa/Altimeter 29.92]."
  Pilot: "After departure fly runway heading, climb to 3000 feet [QNH1013 HPa/Altimeter 29.92], Fastjet 345."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, readback correct, taxi to [...]."

If ATIS is available, the pilot **SHALL** include the information designator in his initial communication to the ground controller.

!!! example Initial comms with ATIS available
Pilot: "Anapa Ground, Fastjet 345, [single/_number_] [aircraft type] at [apron/ramp name], ready to taxi, information Alpha."

##VFR Clearance

Visual Flight Rules clearances **MUST** only be issued during daytime and within Visual Meteorological (VMC) conditions. Clearances **SHOULD** include instructions of exiting the airfield control zone. This may consist of a departure heading or a Visual Reference Point, if a VFR chart is available for that airfield. 

!!!example "VFR Example with VRP"
  Pilot: "Anapa Ground, Fastjet 345, [single/_number_] [aircraft type] at [apron/ramp name], VFR flight to Krymsk, ready to taxi."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, Anapa Ground, after departure cleared to leave control zone via Entry/Exit East, not above 2500 feet, [QNH1013 HPa/Altimeter 29.92], squawk 1234."
  Pilot: After departure cleared to leave control zone via Entry/Exit East, not above 2500 feet, [QNH1013 HPa/Altimeter 29.92], squawk 1234, Fastjet 345."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, readback correct, taxi to [...]."

If charts are not available, a heading may be used.

!!!example VFR example with departure heading
[...]
Tower: "Fastjet 345, Anapa Ground, after departure cleared to leave control zone, fly heading 080, climb to 2000 feet, [QNH1013 HPa/Altimeter 29.92], squawk 4567."
[...]

For VFR (and simplified) clearances, the Ground controller **MAY** opt to give departure clearance at the holding point, right before takeoff.

!!!example "Clearance at holding point"
  Pilot: "Anapa Ground, Fastjet 345, [single/_number_] [aircraft type] at [apron/ramp name], VFR flight to Krymsk, ready to taxi."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, Anapa Ground, taxi to [...], expect clearance at holding point."
  Pilot: "Taxi to [...], expect clearance at holding point, Fastjet 345."
  At holding point: 
  Pilot: "Anapa Ground, Fastjet 345, holding at/short of [location]."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, advise ready to copy clearance."
  Pilot: "Ready to copy, Fastjet 345."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, Anapa Ground, after departure [...]"
  Pilot: "After departure [...], Fastjet 345."

##IFR Clearance

IFR flights will be given predefined departure routes called Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs), if available. The alternative is radar vectoring provided by the area controller after departing the airfield control zone. 

IFR clearances **MUST** be delivered in a standardised format. A good mnemonic for remembering it is CRAFT.

- **C**learance: Point to which the clearance is valid. This may be a destination airfield, or perhaps an Operating Area, where the aircraft will be handed to tactical air control.
- **R**oute: Path that the aircraft will take to depart the airfield. May be vectors, or a predefined Standard Instrument Departure.
- **A**ltitude: Maximum altitude to which the aircraft is cleared. This may be lower than the altitude levels defined by the SID, if necessary for traffic spacing.
- **F**requency: Frequency the aircraft must switch to when requested by the tower controller. Under ICAO procedures this is often omitted.
- **T**ransponder: Mode 3 squawk code that the aircraft should set into its transponder.

!!!example "IFR Clearance example"
  Pilot: "Krasnodar Ground, Fastjet 345, [single/_number_] [aircraft type] at [apron/ramp name], request clearance to Sochi, IFR."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, Krasnodar Ground, advise ready to copy IFR clearance."
  Pilot: "Ready to copy, Fastjet 345."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, cleared to Sochi, RANIS6T departure, climb to flight level 170, squawk 1234."
  Pilot: "Cleared to Sochi, RANIS6T departure, climb to flight level 170, squawk 1234, Fastjet 345."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, readback correct, report ready to taxi."

A radar vector departure is as follows.  

!!!example "Departure via vectors"
[...]
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, cleared to Sochi, departure via radar vectors, climb to 5000 feet, [QNH1013 HPa/Altimeter 29.92], squawk 1234."
  Pilot: "cleared to Sochi, departure via radar vectors, climb to 5000 feet, [QNH1013 HPa/Altimeter 29.92], squawk 1234, Fastjet 345."
  Tower: "Fastjet 345, readback correct, report ready to taxi."
