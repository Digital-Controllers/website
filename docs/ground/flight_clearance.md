## Introduction

An ATC clearance is an authorization by ATC, for the purpose of preventing collision between known aircraft, for an aircraft to proceed under specified conditions within controlled airspace.

Prior to taxi, pilots SHOULD receive a flight clearance for their intended sortie.
This may be a simple VFR clearance, or a full IFR clearance that is issued based on a verbal request from the pilot to ATC, or based on a pre-filed flight plan.
A clearance may be to the final destination or partial clearance.

For example, a pilot MAY request a clearance via a pre-defined route to an Operating Area (AO) and then cancel IFR to fly VFR in the AO.
Once complete and ready to return, the pilot MAY request IFR clearance back to their destination airport.

When practicable, pilots SHOULD file a flight plan with the correct controlling agency prior to departure.
