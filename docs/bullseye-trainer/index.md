# DCS Bullseye Trainer

Welcome to the DCS Bullseye Trainer!

If you are already familiar with what bullseye is and just want to get straight to the training, select the Trainer.

If you would like information about how bullseye works, see the guide.

Using the trainer is simple. The program will give you your own location in bullseye format, as well as the enemy's location in bullseye format. Try to do the math in your head to solve for the azimuth and distance from your ship to the enemy's. The Trainer omits altitudes as they aren't required for the exercise.
