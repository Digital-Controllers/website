## Dos and Don'ts

**Thanks for your interest in contributing! We massively appreciate your support. Before you get started, we do have a couple of standards and rules to adhere to:**

**Do:**

- write in British English, for the sake of standardisation.
- write in a concise and simple manner, limiting the number of separate pages necessary.
- ask for advice in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/8qXDBVs2XU) if you're unsure - we're all in this together!
- include citations at the bottom of a page, if you're referencing advanced stuff or stating certain things as absolute fact. For example, basic commands such as "turn right/left bearing *xxx*" don't require citations, since they are taken as common knowledge.

**Don't:**

- overwrite lots of information without consulting others first.
- reference any documentation you are not *100% certain* is *unclassified* and completely available to the public. Documents restricted by distribution statements are *not* unclassified.
- add images and sounds unless you're confident your use falls under Fair Use or is otherwise permitted by the media's copyright license. Wikimedia is a good place to search for examples.
